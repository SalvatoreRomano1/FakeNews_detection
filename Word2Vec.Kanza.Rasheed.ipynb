    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "* According to the results, the best classifiers for word2vec with \"fake and real news dataset\" are Logistic Regression and XGBoost with over 91% accuracy.\n",
    "* However, XGBoost takes a lot more time than logistic regression and therefore, I wasnt able to apply GridCVSearch with XGBoost.\n",
    "* Keeping the time and accuracy in perspective, Logistic Regression is better as compared to XGBoost with high accuracy and minimum time for the fake and real dataset.\n",
    "* On the other hand, random forest gives the best results for the Liar Liar Dataset. \n",
    "* The performance of XGBoost with Word2Vec on Liar Liar dataset was surprisingly not vey high. \n",
    "* Hence, it can be concluded, the performance of different classifiers also depends on the context of the dataset and the features extracted thourgh Word2Vec since they have a direct link with the vocabulary developed.\n",
    "* Best Results--> Word2Vec+Log Regression on fake and real dataset after tuning of the Word2Vec model and and tuning of hyperparameters of the classifiers"
